Glass flowers made in Processing

Generative glass flowers created by rotating randomly generated PShapes.

Press any key to stop the current set of petals.  Press the key fairly quickly for best results.  Click the mouse to grow a new interior set.  Growth will stop after four sets of petals (this is controllable by changing the vertexChange variable--a lower number means more layers before the flower stops growing entirely).  Scroll the mouse wheel to to reset the interior counter and begin growing sets of petals again on the same flower.  Click the mouse while petals are growing to completely reset the flower and grow a new one.
